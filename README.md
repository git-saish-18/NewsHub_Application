# Web-based News Application

A Web-based News Application is a platform that enables users to view news articles from different categories. This application utilizes several technologies, including React.js, HTML, CSS, and News API integration.

In the project, I utilized React.js, a JavaScript library, to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces. With reusable UI components, the application efficiently renders and updates data as needed. HTML was used to structure the content and layout of the web pages, while CSS was employed to enhance the visual presentation and ensure a consistent user interface design.

To fetch news data, I integrated the application with a News API. This allowed for seamless retrieval and display of news articles from different categories. The integration ensured that the application provided up-to-date and relevant news content to users.
